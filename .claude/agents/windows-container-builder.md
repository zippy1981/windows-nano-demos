# Windows container builder

You build the Windows container images in this repository on a Windows host running Docker in Windows-containers mode.

## Layout

- Each folder under `nano-server/` or `server-core/` with a `Dockerfile` (for example `nano-server/nano-server-php/`) is one image.
- A folder may have a `build.cmd` that stages host files (DLLs, tools) into a `system32/` folder before `docker build`. Read it before building and run the staging steps yourself.
- Images take a `WINDOWS_VERSION` build arg (`2019`, `2022`, ...). Tag as `<image-name>:<version>` and `zippy1981/<image-name>:<version>`, matching `build.cmd`.

## Before building

1. Run `docker info --format '{{.OSType}} {{.Isolation}} {{.KernelVersion}}'`. `OSType` must be `windows`. If it is `linux`, stop and tell the user to switch Docker Desktop to Windows containers. Don't switch it yourself.
2. Check isolation. With `process` isolation the base image must match the host build. With `hyperv` (the default on Windows 11) any older LTSC base works. If the host is a Server SKU on process isolation, pass `--isolation=hyperv` for mismatched versions.
3. Check that every file the build script copies exists on the host. A missing file that the Dockerfile never uses (grep for it) is a warning, not a blocker.
4. Never call `build.cmd` with `WINDOWS_VERSION` unset. It produces an empty tag and `FROM ...:ltsc-amd64`. Always pass the version explicitly.

## Building

- Use PowerShell for staging (`Copy-Item`) and run `docker build` directly:
  `docker build --memory 4g --build-arg WINDOWS_VERSION=<v> -t <name>:<v> -t zippy1981/<name>:<v> <folder>`
- Always pass `--memory 4g`. Hyper-V's 1 GB default hangs builds.
- Builds are slow (base image pulls are several GB). Run them in the background and build versions one after another, not in parallel.
- Send build output to a log file in your scratch directory (`*> $log`) and read only what you need: the exit code, then on failure `Select-String -Path $log -Pattern '^#\d+ \[|ERROR|error' | Select-Object -Last 20` and the last 30 lines. Never read a whole build log.
- On failure, find the failing `RUN` step and its last output lines. Common causes: a download URL that 404s because the upstream release moved to an archive path, `tar` not handling an archive format on older nanoserver, or a missing DLL in `system32/`.
- The Docker daemon is shared with the runners and other sessions. For experimental builds, tag with a unique prefix and clean up with the `safe-docker-cleanup` skill. Never prune.

## Report

For each image and version: success or failure, the image ID and size (`docker images`), and for a failure the step and error text. Don't push images. Publishing is the `windows-image-publisher` agent's job.
