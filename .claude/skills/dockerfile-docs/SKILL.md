description: How every Dockerfile in this repo documents itself - a header that says what the image is and how to build it, and a comment above each build argument that says what it does and how to set it. Use when writing or changing a Dockerfile, adding an ARG, or reviewing Dockerfile comments. tests/test_dockerfile_docs.py enforces it.

# Dockerfile documentation

Each Dockerfile explains itself, so you don't need the README to build it. `tests/test_dockerfile_docs.py` checks every image under `nano-server/` and `server-core/`, with one test per image and per build argument.

## The header

The file starts with a comment block, before the first `ARG`:

```dockerfile
# windows-nano-go: Go, MinGit and the micro editor on Nano Server. CI builds the three newest Go releases.
# Docker Hub categories: languages-and-frameworks, developer-tools
#
# (optional) Anything a builder must know first, such as a base-image exception for one Windows version.
#
# Build from this folder (build.cmd does the same, and also tags zippy1981/windows-nano-go):
#   docker build --memory 4g --build-arg WINDOWS_VERSION=2022 --build-arg GO_VERSION=1.26.10 -t windows-nano-go:2022 .
# Each build argument is described where it is declared below.
```

- **First line:** `# <published image name>: <what the image is>`. Write one sentence that a person choosing an image would understand. It should say what's installed, not how it's built. Leave out issue and ADR numbers, which mean nothing on Docker Hub.
- **Categories line:** `# Docker Hub categories: <slug>[, <slug>...]`, with one to three slugs from <https://hub.docker.com/v2/categories>. Pick what someone browsing Docker Hub would look under:

  | The image is mainly | Categories |
  | --- | --- |
  | a language toolchain (Go, Rust, PHP, PowerShell) | `languages-and-frameworks, developer-tools` |
  | interactive tools, such as editors and file managers | `developer-tools` |
  | CI infrastructure, such as runners and the artifact cache | `integration-and-delivery`, plus `developer-tools`, `networking` or `web-servers` as fits |
  | a database server | `databases-and-storage` |
  | a network service, such as SSH | `networking`, plus `security` if access control is the point |

  Don't use `operating-systems`. These images run *on* Windows, but they aren't base OS images.
- **Build example:** include a `docker build` line with at least one `--build-arg`, and `--memory 4g` (Hyper-V's 1 GB default hangs builds).
- **No `key=value` on the first line.** Docker would read `# key=value` there as a parser directive.

## Build arguments

Put a comment directly above the first `ARG` of each name, with no blank line between them. The comment says what the argument is, its default if that isn't obvious, and how to set it with `--build-arg NAME=<example>`:

```dockerfile
# Windows Server LTSC version to build for: 2019, 2022 or 2025 (the default). Set with --build-arg WINDOWS_VERSION=2022.
ARG WINDOWS_VERSION=2025
# The image the final stage is built on. Defaults to nanoserver-base for WINDOWS_VERSION (ADR 0017); CI pins it to a digest.
# Set with --build-arg BASE_IMAGE=zippy1981/nanoserver-base:ltsc2022.
ARG BASE_IMAGE=zippy1981/nanoserver-base:ltsc${WINDOWS_VERSION}
```

- Use the standard `WINDOWS_VERSION` and `BASE_IMAGE` wording above. For Server Core images, say Server Core and use the servercore example.
- An explanation that belongs with the argument, such as why Far needs Server Core, goes in the same comment block, ending with the `Set with` line.
- A repeated `ARG NAME` inside a later stage only brings the value into that stage, so it needs no comment.
- Tool versions pinned with `ENV`, not `ARG`, aren't build arguments. Comment them where it helps, but the test doesn't require it.

## Who writes it

`container-author`, `windows-demo-scaffolder` and `windows-deps-updater` write the Dockerfile and a first draft of these comments. They then hand the file to `markdown-reviewer`, which checks the wording and this format. It starts `markdown-fixer` to apply the changes, then runs `uv run pytest -q tests/test_dockerfile_docs.py`.

## On Docker Hub

The documentation is published with the image. `scripts/Publish-DockerHubDocs.ps1` turns the header's description into the Docker Hub short description, which allows at most 100 characters. It turns the image's `README.md` into the overview, with relative links rewritten to GitHub URLs. It also sets the header's categories.

Docker Hub's API documents categories only as readable, so the script sends them and then reads them back. If they didn't stick, it prints a `Docker Hub categories` warning and the publish still succeeds. Then set them by hand: My Hub → Repositories → the repository → the pencil icon under the description.

The shared workflow:

- runs the script with `-WhatIf` on every build, pull requests included, so a description that is too long or a missing README fails early
- runs it for real after a push to `main`
- sets the `org.opencontainers.image.description` and `documentation` labels on the image

The `Docker Hub docs` workflow (`dockerhub-docs.yml`, run by hand from `main`) updates every published repository's documentation without rebuilding any image.

To preview an overview locally, run `./scripts/Publish-DockerHubDocs.ps1 -Context <folder> -Repository zippy1981/<image> -WhatIf -PreviewPath overview.md`.
