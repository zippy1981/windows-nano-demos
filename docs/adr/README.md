# Architecture decision records

These records explain why this repo is built the way it is. Each one covers a single decision in MADR style: status, context, decision, consequences, and alternatives considered. To add one, use the `adr` agent or copy the layout of an existing record into the next number, and add it to this table. To change a decision, write a new record that supersedes the old one.
